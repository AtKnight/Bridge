        # In import format, a tag pair that already occurred, is ignored.
        #
        # Export format: The export format is rather strict and is used to describe
        # data that is usually prepared under program control.
        # Tag pairs may only occur once.

        # The escape character "%" in the first column means that the rest of the line
        # can be ignored.

        # in a line does not trigger the escape mechanism.

        # % is proposed used for:
        #   (1) It indicates the version of the PBN standard used by a computer program. The syntax is: 
        # % PBN <major version #>.<minor version #>
        #   (2) It indicates that a PBN file has export format. The syntax is: 
        # % EXPORT

        # A white space character can never be part of a token.
