NAME
       dealer - bridge hand generator

SYNOPSIS
       dealer [-023ehuvmqV] [-p n] [-g n] [-s seed] [-l n] [inputfile]

DESCRIPTION AND EXAMPLE
       The program dealer can be used to generate hands for partnerships
       bidding training or for generating statistics that can be used to
       design conventions, or win postmortems.

       Running the program involves 3 steps. First, the user has to write an
       input file containing hand-descriptions and action. A very simple
       example would look something like:

           condition shape(north, any 4333 + any 4423) and hcp(north)>=19
           action printall

       The first line specifies a condition for the north hand, in this case,
       a hand with 4333 or 4432 shape and at least 19 high card points. The
       second line tells the program to print the 4 hands. The program reads
       from standard input, so in principle, it is possible to enter the
       conditions directly into the program. Using a file is a lot more
       practical though, as it allows the user to re-use conditions and fine-
       tune the conditions.

       Then the program has to be run, it reads the file, looks at the various
       command line switches and then produces a number of hands. The output
       appears on the screen but can be re-directed to a file.

       Finally, the user has to look at output and analyze the produced hands.
       Alternatively, the output can be used for a playing program.

OPTIONS
       -e  Exhaust mode (alpha version).

       -g number
           Maximum number of hands to generate (default is 1000000).

       -l number
           Instead of shuffling, deals are read from the file library.dat by
           M. Ginsberg (see [1]). When using this, the tricks() function is
           quite fast and bridge.exe from GIB is not used.

       -m  Shows a progress meter.

       -p number
           Maximum number of hands to produce (default is 40).

       -q  Suppress PBN output (useful for testing, then switch it back on
           when generating the "final" sample).

       -s number
           Uses number as the seed for the random generator, running the
           program twice with the same seed will produce the same sequence of
           hands.

       -u  Select uppercase for the symbols "AKQJT" (default is lowercase).

       -v  Toggle verbose output, prints statistics at the end of the run
           (default is on).

       -V  Emit a version-identification string and exit.

       -h  Help, prints the syntax.

       -0  No swapping, each deal is generated normally (shuffling) (default).

       -2  2-way swapping, after each shuffle another deal is generated by
           permuting E and W, leaving N and S in place (NB: not fully
           compatible with predeal).

       -3  3-way swapping, after each shuffle another 5 deals are generated by
           permuting E, W, and S every which way, leaving N in place (NB: not
           fully compatible with predeal).

BUGS
       I would prefer if you did not use this program for generating hands for
       tournaments. I have not investigated the random number generation
       closely enough for me to be comfortable with that thought.
